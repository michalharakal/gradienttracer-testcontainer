# 10. Quality Requirements

## 10.1 Quality Tree
- Reproducibility
- Testability
- Observability
- Performance (acceptable build times)
- Security (container hardening)

## 10.2 Quality Scenarios
- A developer can run tests on a fresh machine with only Docker and Maven installed; image builds and tests pass.
- A CI run builds the image once and executes multiple tests using the same container image.
- Failures in Python executions return non-zero exit codes and readable stderr logs.
