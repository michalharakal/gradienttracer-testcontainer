# 1. Introduction and Goals

This document describes the architecture of the GradientTracer Testcontainers module. The goal is to enable Java-based tests to control a containerized Python GradientTracer environment conveniently and reproducibly.

- Primary stakeholders: Java developers, QA engineers, DevOps.
- Primary goals:
  - Start/stop GradientTracer within Testcontainers.
  - Execute Python modules/commands and capture outputs in tests.
  - Keep images reproducible and versions pinned.

## 1.1 Requirements Overview
- Provide a Java API that wraps Testcontainers GenericContainer for GradientTracer usage.
- Support executing `python`, `python -m gradienttracer`, and future CLI forms.
- Support bind mounts for scripts and retrieving artifacts.
- Optional: expose ports if GradientTracer provides services.

## 1.2 Quality Goals
- Developer productivity in tests.
- Reproducibility across CI and local environments.
- Observability: clear logs and exit codes.

## 1.3 Stakeholders
- Project maintainers (code owners)
- Test writers and CI maintainers
- Security reviewers (container content)
